#**PID Controller** 

---

**PID Controller Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Build a PID controller 
* Tune the PID hyperparameters using manual tuning, twiddle, SGD or a combination.
* Test your solution on the simulator!
* Validate the vehicle is able to drive successfully around the track without leaving the road. Try to see how fast you get the vehicle to SAFELY go!
* Summarize the reflection with a written report

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/824/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* writeup_report.md summarizing the results
